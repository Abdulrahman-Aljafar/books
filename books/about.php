                              We believe that bookstores are essential to a healthy culture. 
                              They’re where authors can connect with readers, 
                              where we discover new writers, where children get hooked on the thrill of reading that can last a lifetime.
                              They’re also anchors for our downtowns and communities.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            As more and more people buy their books online, we wanted to create an easy, convenient way for you to get your books and support bookstores at the same time.
